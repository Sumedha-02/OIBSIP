# OIBSIP
It's a GitHub repository for the Oasis Infobyte Internship program. I have uploaded all projects which I have made in this Internship Journey.

The projects are -
- Unemployment Analysis with Python
- Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
- Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
### About the Company
**Oasis Infobyte** is a community of diverse people coming together with similar objectives and ultimate goals. It's all about creating opportunities for leadership development, learning, student engagement, and fostering shared interests. We develop enriching environments and experiences that promote students' knowledge and well-being.

## Unemployment Analysis with Python
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour face. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good Data Science project.

## Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives, and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning.

## Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
We have all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.
In this project I use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam(ham).
